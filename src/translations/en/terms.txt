Last updated May 2, 2020

## Preamble

{{productName}} is a project by Bayes Impact, a nonprofit organization dedicated to using technology for social good. It is managed by Bayes Impact’s France-based branch (association de loi 1901), {{owner}}.

{{productName}}’s source code is availably under a GPLv3 open source license.
No personal data are stored outside of the user’s device. No tracking is performed, whether by GPS or Bluetooth.
The user’s personal data (including their potential symptoms or contact list) are stored locally on their device (phone, laptop, etc.). They are not transmitted to anyone, including {{owner}}. They stay under the sole control of the user.
Anonymized usage data (such as the aggregate number of users using {{productName}}) allow {{owner}} to continuously improve {{productName}} and estimate its impact. These data do not allow one to personally identify a user.
An optional symptom monitoring functionality is provided on a voluntary basis within {{productName}}. When this optional feature is activated, the user may communicate their email address, in order to receive regular email check-ins from {{owner}}. {{owner}} will then store the user’s email address for a maximum duration of 14 days. This email address cannot be linked to the user’s activity on {{productName}}. If the user wishes to, they can at any time request the data’s deletion by writing to privacy@bayesimpact.org.
None of the data mentioned above may be used for any commercial purpose.

## 1. Definitions

"{{productName}}" or "the service" is a tool designed to help users notify individuals they may have met during their contagious period, by helping them establish their contagious period and remember encounters during this period. It also suggests ways to contact them, both personally and anonymously. {{productName}} is not intended as a medical diagnostic tool.

The developer of the website is "{{owner}}", a non-profit organization.

The web host is OVH.

The "users" are individuals that use the platform.

The service is available on "the website": [{{canonicalUrl}}]({{canonicalUrl}})

## 2. Validity and Approval

The hereby terms are always available on the website {{canonicalUrl}} and shared to any user that requires them.

They handle the relationship between the users and {{productName}} in how they use the service.

The users acknowledge their right to utilize the service.

Using the service and its information implies a complete and unconditional approval of these terms. Their rejection leads to renouncing the use of the service and the use of its information.

## 3. Scope

The hereby contract solely governs the use of {{productName}} by the users.

It is delivered free-of-charge by {{owner}} and without any other compensation than the respect of the hereby terms.

The responsibility of {{owner}} is exclusively limited to giving access to the platform.

{{owner}} cannot be held responsible for an unlawful use of the service.

## 4. Description of the Service

{{productName}} is an independant platform developed by {{owner}} which is an "association loi 1901".

The service assumes validation of several steps.

### 4.1. Non-medical Diagnostic from Symptoms

At first, {{productName}} issues to the user a non-binding and non-medical diagnostic from an algorithm on probability for being contaminated by {{diseaseName}} by perusing the symptoms they have declared. This consultative advice can in no way be a substitute for a real diagnostic given by a medical doctor, a member of the nursing staff, a certified testing process or any government-authorized process.

If the user has already been tested positive for {{diseaseName}} by medical means, they can share this information directly and won't be asked any more information on their health status to benefit from the service provided by {{productName}}.

This non-medical diagnostic is based on up-to-date scientific research about {{diseaseName}}. It may evolve.

### 4.2. Establishing the Contagious Period

In the next step, the service establishes the probable contagious period for the user, in order to help them remember the people they met during these days.

The given period is purely indicative, and is in no way a certified medical data.

How this period is computed is also based on up-to-date scientific research on {{diseaseName}} and is subject to change.

### 4.3. Helping to Look for People Met during the Contagious Period

The service entice the user to remember each and every person they've met during the contagious period. To that end, it gives memory joggers and mnemonic questions about everyday activities.

The user may, if they wish so and under their explicit approval, access personal data, such as their calendar or phone contacts, using APIs.

The service also asks the user two questions to estimate the proximity level of the encounters, based on its duration and the physical distance between its protagonists.

All this data is used and stored only on the user's device. They are not transmitted to anyone, either directly or in derived form. They remain in full ownership of the user.

### 4.4. Helping to Notify Met People during the Contagious Period

The service then suggest the user to notify the people that have been identified as "contact cases".

To that end, the user may copy an automatically-generated message from the service and send it through the messaging medium of their choice, or using voluntarily the API they chose.

The user may also ask {{productName}} for an anonymous notification of a given contact case. The organization {{owner}} and the service {{productName}} do not keep any identifiable trace of these interactions between the user and their contact.

### 4.5 Follow-up for Contact Cases

If a person, which is initially a non-user, is identified as a contact case by a possibly {{diseaseName}}-infected user, they are invited to use the service too.

A link allows them to take note of their probable "contact case" status and invite them to evaluate their possible contamination to {{diseaseName}} using the same symptoms-based non-medical diagnostic.

If the diagnostic establishes a possible contamination to {{diseaseName}}, this person is invited to go through the whole identification and notification of contact cases process, as would be any user.

If the declared symptoms do not suggest the person has been contaminated to {{diseaseName}}, the services suggests to subscribe, using the person's email, to the follow-up feature. As a reminder, this feature allows the sending of regular emails advising and reminding the person to be vigilant about their possible symptoms of {{diseaseName}}. Subscribing to this feature is voluntary and cancelable.

The feature's lifetime is of 14 days. After this time, the user's email that had been stored for this purpose is automatically deleted.

## 5. Use of Service

### 5.1. Use of {{productName}}

While using the platform, users commit to abide by applicable laws and regulations, and not to undermine public order or other people's rights.

Users are solely responsible for completing any administrative or medical requirements with regards to their health. Concerning help or medical testing procedures, they are solely responsible to get the means to fulfill them. As such, {{owner}} cannot be liable in any way.

Users acknowledge having taken note of specifications and constraints of the platform, especially technical ones. They are solely responsible for its use. Users are informed and agree that the platform needs an Internet connection to which they endorse full responsibility, and on which the service's quality depends.

Users are also solely responsible of any relationship they may form with people from services they may contact following the service's suggestions, especially medical help or testing organizations.

### 5.2. Persistence of Data during a User's Workflow on their Web Browser

Using cookies and local storage, the user may stop and restart their workflow on the service, using the same device at different times. This persistence is optional, and the user may choose to decline it at any time. It does not imply in any way that the user's personal data may be stored by {{productName}}. This persistence cannot be assimilated with a user account feature.

Since {{productName}} doesn't save any data, the service cannot prevent users from a potential loss of the information they declared on the platform. It is the user's responsibility to keep a copy of their data. They cannot ask for any compensation for any data loss.
